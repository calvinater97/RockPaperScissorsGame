# Overview

* This app will allow the user to play a game of rock, paper, scissors, lizard, spock from their apple phones.  The screen opens up with a display if five buttons to choose from.  Once you make your decision then the results will be displayed and you will know if you won the game or if you need to give it another try. 

* The purpose of this software is give the user a fun game they can play and also help me to understand different elements of coding in the swift language along with the building blocks of creating an ios app.
